### Features

: - Introduced a new `executePrefix` property for handling prefix commands.

    * `permissions`
    * `usage`
- Following Slash Command Properties are now optional:
    * `name` - slash commands only
    * `description` - slash commands only
- New Slash Command Property:
    *  `global`: boolean; default is false
        + Allows creation of global slash command for the specific command file
- `customIds` Property is now changed to be Array of Strings and no longer accepts Objects
- Updated `slashCommandIdsToDelete` property to be an object containing two property: `global` and `guild`
  * Each of these property are an Array<String> containing the slash commands ids to be deleted
- Recommended name changes to Command Properties:
    - These changes are not mandatory until v4.0.0
    - For executing prefix commands: `execute` → `executePrefix`
        - Added console warnings when prefix commands use `execute` instead of `executePrefix`.
    - For executing slash commands: `interactionReply` → `execute`
        - Added console warnings when slash commands use `interactionReply` instead of `execute`.
### Deprecation
: - `interactionReply` is now deprecated. It will continue to work in v3.x, but logs a console warning.  
  Please migrate to `execute`, as `interactionReply` will be removed in v4.0.0.

## 3.0.0

### Features
: - Added new optional options to `DiscordFeaturesHandlerOptions`:
    * `slashCommandIdsToDelete`: Array of strings for deleting specific slash command IDs.
    * `onSlashCommandsLoading`: Object of booleans for enabling the deletion of slash commands before loading new ones.
- Updated `CommandFile` properties:
    * Changed `customIds` to accept either an array of strings (`customIds`) or an object of key–value pairs.
    * Removed `componentInteraction`, `autoCompleteInteraction`, `contextMenuInteraction`, and `modalInteraction`, replacing them with a single universal property: `customIdInteraction`.  
      This new property handles interactions based on `customIds`.
    * Added `customIdInteraction(interaction, client, level)` to `CommandFile` properties to ensure that no button or other customId-based interaction becomes inactive if the bot application or collector times out.
